# ProjectWeekVIII
An application with user's credentials (name, email, password).

Project Compass PB Week VIII - "Alpha Test 1.0.0"

This project is an application with a login screen where the user can input their email and password credentials
There's another screen with the SignUp credentials that the user can navigate to if they don't have an account. This screen has
a checkbox that the user needs to check to login correctly.
If the user try to log in without entering any information in the inputs, a warning message is displayed on the screen.
After logging in, the user reachs a 'dummy' Home screen. They can go back to Login or Signup screen from there.

* The credentials are not validated and not connected to any backend.
* The fonts are not exactly the same as the UI Prototype due an issue whith the VSCode. This problem will be corrected for the future Versions.
